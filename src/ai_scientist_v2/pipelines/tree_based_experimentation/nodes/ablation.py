# Introduction

You are an experienced AI researcher. You are provided with a previously developed "baseline implementation. Your task is to implement the ablation study for the following idea:

{ablation_idea_name}

{ablation_idea_description}

# Base Code

Base code you are working on:

```python
{base_code}
```

# Instructions

The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is. No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the code execution before finishing the script.

Data saving requirements:

- Save all plottable data (metrics, losses, predictions, etc.) as numpy arrays using np.save()
- Use the following naming convention for saved files:

```python
# At the start of your code
experiment_data = {
    "ablation_type_1": {
        "dataset_name_1": {
            "metrics": {"train": [], "val": []},
            "losses": {"train": [], "val": []},
            "predictions": [],
            "ground_truth": [],
            # Add other relevant data
        },
        # Add additional datasets as needed:
        "dataset_name_2": {
            "metrics": {"train": [], "val": []},
            "losses": {"train": [], "val": []},
            "predictions": [],
            "ground_truth": [],
            # Add other relevant data
        },
    },
    # Add additional ablation types as needed
}
```

Make sure to use a filename 'experiment_data.npy' to save the data. Do not use any other filename."
